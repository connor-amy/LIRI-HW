# LIRI-HW
Not sure which .gitignore to add. Did the Node one.

Instructions:

1. To use Liri, open the Node.js command prompt and cd your way to where you    downloaded the files and into the liri-node-app folder.

2. Run liri by typing: node liri.js <command> <"parameter"> 
   but without the <>.

3. Available commands:
	1. my-tweets (no paramater. Example: node liri.js my-tweets)
	2. spotify-this-song (optional parameter: "Song name", in quotes, 			      but replace song name with the song name.                               Example: node liri.js spotify-this "Rock On").

	3. movie-this (optional parameter: "Movie name", in quotes, but 	                      replace movie name with the movie name.
                      Example: node liri.js movie-this "Star Wars").

	4. do-what-it-says (no parameter, will read the text in random.txt                               and execute the command there. Format is:                             command,"parameter". 
                            Example: node liri.js do-what-it-says)

4. If no parameter is given for commands that accept them, a default    song/movie is selected.
